        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>This is a tool I have written in VueJS 3 after informally taking an intro to a Vue 3 course.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, after each lesson's exercise, I was too cocky to confirm against the provided solution- after all, mine works, right?</p>
        <p>Well, not always, that's the attitude that gets you into touble fast working with a library or framework you haven't taken time to familiarise yourself with properly.</p>
        <p>So this? This is my Mia Culpa and an attempt at a close look at how my solutions differed from the provided imlementations.</p>
        <p>This is also me attempting to write a VueJS app more or less from scratch after 2-3 days of learning the basics.</p>
